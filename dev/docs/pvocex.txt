PVOCEX

version of CARL pvoc using the PVOC-EX file format.


usage:

pvocex [flags] infile outfile

type 

pvocex -h

to see all flags.

The most important are:

-N       set size (in samples) of the FFT analysis window. Default is 1024.
           Power-of two sizes are optimal (many FFT implementations only support such sizes),
           but any even number will be accepted.

-F       set fundamental analysis frequency (use instead of -N).
           useful for clearly pitched monophonic sounds, where some other application
           (e.g in Csound, or the CDP system) manipulates the frequency data directly.
           In most cases, it is better to use -N.

-A        perform analysis only - output is .pvx analysis file
-S        perform synthesis only - input is .pvx analysis file

if neither flag is given, input and output are soundfiles.
-Tx      perform time scaling. Ignored if -A flag is used. Value above 1 stretches the sound.
-Px      perform Pitch scaling. Ignored if -A flag is used. Value represents octave ratio (approximately).
           -T and -P cannot be used together.

-Wx    set window overlap factor x. Default is 2, for 8-fold overlap.
           Where time-scaling is not being performed, W can usefully be set to 0 or 1,
           giving a very valuable reduction in processing time. For  pitch-scaling,
           the default W2 is often unsatisfactory - try W1 instead.
           W=3 increases overlap, and hence processing time. It is unlikely to be beneficial unless
          large time-stretch factors are being used. It can preserve accuracy if the sound contains much
          transient or rapidly changing material.

The file pvoc.txt contains the original CARL documentation by Mark Dolson.


PVOCEX2

stereo phase vocoder adapted from CARL pvoc using the PVOC-EX file format.


usage:

pvocex2 [flags] infile outfile

-I       show .pvx format info. The outfile can optionally be omitted.
-K     use Kaiser window
-H     use von Hann (Hanning) window
         (default window is Hamming)
-fx     set frame type for analysis file
         x = 0 = Amplitude,Frequency (default)
         x = 1 = Amplitude,Phase ( = Soundhack format)
         x = 2 = Complex (real,imaginary)
         (NB: -F flag ignored unless -A is set.)
