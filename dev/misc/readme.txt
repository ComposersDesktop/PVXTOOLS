Not much in this directory - yet. It will irregularly expand with various pvoc-related code suitable for libraries (some "historical" examples in vanilla C++).

 - pshift: extracted from CDPR7 code (Trevor Wishart) for pvoc pitch shifting.

 - pvconv:  very old code to convert ancient pvoc files from Csound and Soundhack to pvx.
            I am not seriously expecting anyone to need this...maybe treat it as documentation.
